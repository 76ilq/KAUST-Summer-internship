# NHIS Data Analysis: Chronic Pain and Anxiety/Depression Co-occurrence in US Adults (2019-2021)

## Overview

This project analyzes data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to study the prevalence and impact of co-occurring chronic pain and anxiety/depression among U.S. adults from 2019 to 2021. The analysis aims to provide insights into how these conditions affect functional limitations, general health status, and healthcare utilization.

## Data 

The data used in this project is sourced from the NHIS datasets for the years 2019 to 2021. The NHIS provides nationally representative data on the health status, healthcare access, and health behaviors of the U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized population.

## Key Findings

- **Prevalence:** The study found that 8.3% of U.S. adults experienced both chronic pain and anxiety/depression during the study period.
  
- **Functional Limitations:** Individuals with co-occurring chronic pain and anxiety/depression reported significantly higher levels of difficulty in social activities, performing errands alone, and work limitations compared to those with either condition alone or neither condition.

- **Health Outcomes:** Those with co-occurring conditions also had poorer general health status and a higher likelihood of overnight hospital visits.

- **Predictive Analysis:** Logistic regression models showed that co-occurring chronic pain and anxiety/depression were strong predictors of adverse health outcomes, such as social activity limitations, difficulties in performing errands alone, work restrictions, poorer health, and increased hospitalizations.

## Conclusion

The findings of this study emphasize the significant impact of co-occurring chronic pain and anxiety/depression on individuals' daily lives and overall health. These results underscore the need for integrated care approaches to better manage these overlapping conditions and improve patient outcomes.

## Data Source

The analysis is based on data from the NHIS, conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The NHIS is a vital source of information on the health of the U.S. population and provides nationally representative data on a wide range of health topics.
